### Project 1 Name
# Student Attendance System


Welcome to the Student Attendance System project! This web application is designed to help educational institutions manage and track student attendance efficiently. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Teachers can log in to mark attendance for their classes and view attendance reports.
- Real-time updates on attendance status to ensure accurate tracking.
- Interactive dashboard to provide an overview of attendance statistics.

# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Disease Prediction project! This machine learning application is designed to predict diseases based on user-entered symptoms. It leverages machine learning algorithms to provide accurate disease predictions.

## How it Works

1. User enters their symptoms into the application.
2. The machine learning model processes the input and predicts the most probable disease.
3. The prediction is displayed to the user along with relevant information about the disease.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is trained on a dataset containing symptom-disease mappings. It uses a classification algorithm to predict the disease based on the input symptoms.
